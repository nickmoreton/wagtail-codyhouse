# wagtail CMS using codyhouse framework in the frontend

wagtail==2.9.3 for python3.5 compatability but you can change it...

Edit .gitpod.Dockerfile and change this line:
RUN pyenv install 3.5.9 && pyenv global 3.5.9

or

comment out the line to use the default version that starts up in gitpod.

=========================

The overall process installs codyhouse framework into `_theme`
